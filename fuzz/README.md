# Fuzzing

Uses [cargo-afl](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-afl) for [fuzz testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzing). Note that this only works on Linux.

From root directory
```
cargo-afl afl system-config
cargo afl build --release -p rustyms-fuzz
cargo afl fuzz -i fuzz/in_pro_forma -o out_pro_forma target/release/pro_forma
```
Several fuzz targets are defined: `pro_forma`, `sloppy_pro_forma`, and `peaks`. The two peptide targets share the `in_pro_forma` directory with input examples. The peaks target has `in_peaks` as directory of input examples.

After running the fuzzer the following commands can be used to easily save all crashes into a single file.
```
open out_pro_forma/default/crashes/* | save crashes.txt -f (nushell)
cat out_pro_forma/default/crashes/* >> crashes.txt (bash)
```
